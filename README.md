I am an Iranian&mdash;never choose to be, born as&mdash;and as a result, have always been under extreme discrimination in my life. I was born far after the Iranian revolution (something I had nothing to do with, and has made our lives a hell) but because of that I have always been counted as a terrorist. I mean you only wanna make pretty stuff and yet, one day you wake up seeing years of your work being locked. Why you ask? Because since you are an Iranian you automatically count for a weapon maker.

I don't think that even the dumbest of intelligence services or military labs would ever put even their most obvious and stupid things on a service like GitHub. Imagine CIA putting their PRIZM program's asset in here. But okay, even for a second let's assume they are, so because you are an Iranian that makes you a weapon maker and terrorist? That is the most racist and offensive thing I have ever witnessed.

For a company that talks on diversity, for a company that goes black for the black community, rainbow for the LGBTQ, isn't it disgusting that GitHub advertises publicity-seeking things like changing _master_ to _main_ and be this racist? 

Shame on you and fuck you GitHub ♥️

Please if you are interested in my work, [please do visit my own git server](https://codes.kary.us). Love you guys.
