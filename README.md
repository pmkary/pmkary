I am an Iranian&mdash;never choose to be, born as&mdash;and as a result, have always been under extreme discrimination in my life. I was born far after the Iranian revolution (somthing I had nothing to do with, and has made our lives a hell) but because of that I have always been counted as a terorist. I always wanted to make pretty stuff and never cared about politics. Yet one day you wake up seeing years of your work beeing locked into the github saying that "You are making weapons" and banned all us Iranians from this website. I could tolerate that I get banned because of my nationality, but honestly calling us all teroriost who make weapons in their repos was way more offensive that it should be.

So dear GitHub: Fuck you. I wish you someday wake up underestanding changing the name of "master" to "main" does not change racism when you take a whole nation for weapon maker terorists.

Please if you are interested in my work, [visit my own git server](https://codes.kary.us). Love you ♥️
